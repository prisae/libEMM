Acknowledgement: The initiative to start this ficititious wave domain modelling project begins when I was a scientist working in Electromagnetic Geoservices ASA (EMGS). I developed some modeling codes in my free time, but they never work correctly.  After I left EMGS in 2020, I restarted everything from scratch using all things I learned from Madagascar open software development. It took me more than one year to make it work correctly: the solution now matches the semi-analytic one. During the development, I benefit from the discussion with Rune Mittet, in order to understand his method.
